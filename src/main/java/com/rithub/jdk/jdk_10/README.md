# JDK 10 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 10, released on March 20, 2018, introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 10 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance performance, and provide better support for modern software development practices.

## Major Features

### 1. Local-Variable Type Inference (var)
- Introduction of local-variable type inference using the `var` keyword.
- `var` allows the compiler to infer the type of local variables based on the assigned value, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.

### 2. Consolidation of the JDK Forest
- Transitioned the JDK source code to a single, consolidated repository on GitHub.
- Consolidation simplifies the development and maintenance of the JDK by providing a unified source tree for all components.

### 3. Application Class-Data Sharing (CDS)
- Enhancement of Application Class-Data Sharing (CDS) to improve startup time and reduce memory footprint.
- CDS allows commonly used class metadata to be shared among multiple Java processes, reducing the time and memory required for class loading and initialization.

### 4. Garbage-Collector Interface
- Introduction of a new garbage-collector interface to simplify the development and integration of garbage collectors.
- The garbage-collector interface provides a standard way for garbage collectors to communicate with the JVM and allows for easier implementation of custom garbage collectors.

### 5. Parallel Full GC for G1
- Introduction of parallel full garbage collection for the G1 garbage collector.
- Parallel full GC improves garbage collection performance by utilizing multiple threads to perform full garbage collection concurrently.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Experimental Features
- Introduction of several experimental features, including the introduction of the Java-based JIT compiler, Graal, and the AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler.
- Experimental features provide developers with early access to new functionality and allow for experimentation and feedback.

### 2. Thread-Local Handshakes
- Introduction of thread-local handshakes to improve the efficiency of asynchronous and non-blocking I/O operations.
- Thread-local handshakes allow threads to perform lightweight coordination without the need for global synchronization mechanisms.

### 3. Time-Based Release Versioning
- Introduction of time-based release versioning to provide a predictable release cadence for JDK releases.
- Time-based release versioning ensures that new features and enhancements are delivered to users on a regular schedule, improving transparency and predictability.

## Development Tools
- JDK 10 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including javac, java, jar, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 10 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and integration.
- Local-variable type inference, consolidated JDK repository, and garbage-collector interface provided developers with new tools and capabilities for building modern Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 10 introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and integration. With the introduction of local-variable type inference, consolidated JDK repository, and garbage-collector interface, JDK 10 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for building modern, scalable, and efficient applications.
