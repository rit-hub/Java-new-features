# JDK 12 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 12, released on March 19, 2019, introduced several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 12 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance performance, and provide better support for modern software development practices.

## Major Features

### 1. Switch Expressions (Preview)
- Introduction of switch expressions as a preview feature.
- Switch expressions enhance the traditional switch statement by allowing it to be used as an expression that returns a value.

### 2. Shenandoah Garbage Collector (Experimental)
- Introduction of the Shenandoah garbage collector as an experimental feature.
- Shenandoah GC is a low-pause-time garbage collector designed to reduce application response times by minimizing garbage collection pauses.

### 3. Microbenchmark Suite
- Introduction of a set of microbenchmarks to measure the performance of critical JDK APIs and libraries.
- The microbenchmark suite helps identify performance regressions and optimize critical code paths in the JDK.

### 4. JVM Constants API (Preview)
- Introduction of the JVM Constants API as a preview feature.
- The JVM Constants API provides a standard way to define and use symbolic names for constant pool entries in class files.

### 5. One AArch64 Port, Not Two
- Consolidation of the two AArch64 ports (JDK and OpenJDK) into a single port.
- Consolidation simplifies the maintenance and development of the AArch64 port and improves compatibility between different platforms.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Default CDS Archives
- Introduction of default class data-sharing (CDS) archives for the Java runtime.
- Default CDS archives improve startup time and reduce memory footprint by preloading commonly used classes and resources.

### 2. Unicode 11 Support
- Upgrade of the Unicode support to version 11.0.0.
- Unicode 11 support includes new characters, scripts, and emoji sequences introduced in the Unicode standard.

### 3. New String Methods
- Introduction of new methods in the String class, including `indent`, `transform`, and `describeConstable`.
- New string methods provide additional functionality for manipulating and inspecting strings.

## Development Tools
- JDK 12 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including `javac`, `java`, `jar`, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 12 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and compatibility.
- Switch expressions, Shenandoah GC, and the microbenchmark suite provided developers with new tools and capabilities for building modern Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 12 introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and compatibility. With the introduction of switch expressions, Shenandoah GC, and the microbenchmark suite, JDK 12 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for building modern, scalable, and efficient applications.
