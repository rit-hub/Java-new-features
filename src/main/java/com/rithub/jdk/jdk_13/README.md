# JDK 13 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 13, released on September 17, 2019, introduced several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 13 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance performance, and provide better support for modern software development practices.

## Major Features

### 1. Switch Expressions (Preview)
- Further enhancements to switch expressions, including the ability to use yield statements to return values from switch cases.
- Switch expressions allow for more concise and expressive code compared to traditional switch statements.

### 2. Text Blocks (Preview)
- Introduction of text blocks as a preview feature to simplify the creation of multi-line string literals in Java.
- Text blocks improve code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to write multi-line strings without escaping newline characters.

### 3. ZGC (Experimental)
- Introduction of the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) as an experimental feature.
- ZGC is a low-latency garbage collector designed to minimize pause times and improve application responsiveness.

### 4. Dynamic CDS Archives
- Introduction of dynamic class data-sharing (CDS) archives to improve startup time and reduce memory footprint.
- Dynamic CDS archives allow the runtime to create and update shared archive files at runtime, enabling better optimization and resource utilization.

### 5. Reimplement the Legacy Socket API
- Reimplementation of the legacy Socket API (java.net.Socket) using modern, asynchronous I/O mechanisms.
- The new implementation improves performance and scalability by leveraging non-blocking I/O operations.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. FileSystems.newFileSystem Method
- Introduction of the newFileSystem method in the java.nio.file.FileSystems class to create file systems.
- The new method simplifies the creation of file systems and improves interoperability with different file system types.

### 2. Stack-Walking API Updates
- Updates to the Stack-Walking API to improve the ability to walk the stack trace and inspect stack frames.
- The updated API provides better support for filtering and accessing stack frames in security-sensitive applications.

### 3. Deprecation of the CMS Garbage Collector
- Deprecation of the Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) garbage collector, marking it as obsolete and scheduled for removal in a future release.
- Users are encouraged to migrate to newer garbage collectors such as G1 or ZGC for better performance and scalability.

## Development Tools
- JDK 13 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including javac, java, jar, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 13 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and scalability.
- Switch expressions, text blocks, ZGC, and the updated Stack-Walking API provided developers with new tools and capabilities for building modern Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 13 introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, performance, and scalability. With the introduction of switch expressions, text blocks, ZGC, and updated APIs, JDK 13 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for building modern, scalable, and efficient applications.
