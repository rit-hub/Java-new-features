# JDK 15 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 15, released on September 15, 2020, introduced several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 15 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance performance, and provide better support for modern software development practices.

## Major Features

### 1. Sealed Classes (Preview)
- Introduction of sealed classes and interfaces as a preview feature.
- Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them, providing better encapsulation and maintainability.

### 2. Hidden Classes
- Introduction of hidden classes to improve security and encapsulation in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Hidden classes are classes that cannot be accessed directly from Java code and are used internally by the JVM for dynamic class generation and other purposes.

### 3. Text Blocks (Standard)
- Text blocks, introduced as a preview feature in JDK 13, were made a standard feature in JDK 15.
- Text blocks provide a more readable and maintainable way to write multi-line string literals in Java code.

### 4. ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing
- Enhancement of the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) to perform concurrent thread-stack processing.
- Concurrent thread-stack processing improves the scalability and responsiveness of applications by reducing pause times for garbage collection.

### 5. Unix-Domain Socket Channels
- Introduction of Unix-domain socket channels to support inter-process communication on Unix-like operating systems.
- Unix-domain socket channels provide a more efficient and reliable alternative to network sockets for communication between processes on the same host.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Foreign-Memory Access API (Incubator)
- Introduction of the Foreign-Memory Access API as an incubator feature to provide efficient and safe access to native memory from Java code.
- The Foreign-Memory Access API simplifies the integration of Java applications with native libraries and operating system resources.

### 2. Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
- Introduction of support for the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) in the java.security package.
- EdDSA provides a modern and efficient digital signature algorithm for use in cryptographic applications.

### 3. Deprecation of RMI Activation
- Deprecation of the RMI Activation mechanism and related APIs.
- RMI Activation is marked as deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future release, encouraging developers to use alternative approaches for distributed computing.

## Development Tools
- JDK 15 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including `javac`, `java`, `jar`, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 15 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity, security, and performance.
- Sealed classes, hidden classes, ZGC enhancements, and Unix-domain socket channels provided developers with new tools and capabilities for building modern Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 15 introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, security, and performance. With the introduction of sealed classes, hidden classes, ZGC enhancements, and other features, JDK 15 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for building modern, secure, and scalable applications.
