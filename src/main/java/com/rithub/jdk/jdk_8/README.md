# JDK 8 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8, released on March 18, 2014, introduced significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 8 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance performance, and provide better support for modern programming paradigms.

## Major Features

### 1. Lambda Expressions
- Introduction of lambda expressions, a powerful feature for enabling functional programming in Java.
- Lambda expressions allow the representation of anonymous functions concisely and enable developers to write more expressive and readable code.

### 2. Streams API
- Introduction of the Streams API for processing collections of data in a functional style.
- Streams provide a declarative way to filter, map, and reduce data, enabling parallel processing and simplifying multi-threaded programming.

### 3. Default Methods in Interfaces
- Introduction of default methods in interfaces to enable backward compatibility and enhance API evolution.
- Default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations, enabling the addition of new methods to existing interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

### 4. Date and Time API
- Introduction of the new Date and Time API in the java.time package.
- The Date and Time API provides classes for representing dates, times, time zones, durations, and periods in a more flexible and intuitive way compared to the legacy Date and Calendar classes.

### 5. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
- Introduction of the Nashorn JavaScript engine for improved JavaScript performance and interoperability with Java.
- Nashorn provides a lightweight and high-performance JavaScript runtime environment that can be embedded in Java applications.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Compact Profiles
- Introduction of compact profiles to provide smaller, more manageable Java runtime environments for embedded and resource-constrained devices.
- Compact profiles allow developers to build applications that require only a subset of the Java platform libraries.

### 2. PermGen Removal
- Removal of the Permanent Generation (PermGen) from the Java HotSpot VM.
- PermGen removal simplifies garbage collection and memory management and reduces the risk of memory-related issues.

### 3. Parallel Array Sorting
- Introduction of parallel array sorting methods in the Arrays class for improved sorting performance on multi-core systems.

## Development Tools
- JDK 8 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including javac, java, jar, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 8 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several language features and performance improvements.
- Lambda expressions and the Streams API enabled developers to write more concise, expressive, and efficient code.
- The Date and Time API addressed long-standing issues with date and time manipulation in Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 8 introduced significant features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, enhancing performance, and enabling modern programming paradigms. With the introduction of lambda expressions, the Streams API, and the Date and Time API, JDK 8 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for a wide range of applications.
