# JDK 11 Documentation

## Introduction
Java Development Kit (JDK) 11, released on September 25, 2018, introduced several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements to the Java programming language and platform. JDK 11 aimed to improve developer productivity, enhance security, and provide better support for modern software development practices.

## Major Features

### 1. Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters
- Introduction of the ability to use the `var` keyword in lambda expressions to declare the type of lambda parameters.
- This feature enhances readability and reduces boilerplate code in lambda expressions.

### 2. HTTP Client (Standard)
- Introduction of a new HTTP client API as a standard feature.
- The new HTTP client API provides better support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket protocols, and it is more flexible and efficient compared to the legacy `HttpURLConnection` API.

### 3. Flight Recorder
- Introduction of Flight Recorder as a commercial feature in JDK 11.
- Flight Recorder allows developers to collect detailed runtime information and diagnostic data from Java applications with low overhead.

### 4. Epsilon Garbage Collector
- Introduction of the Epsilon garbage collector, a no-op garbage collector.
- Epsilon GC is useful for scenarios where garbage collection overhead is not a concern, such as batch processing and performance testing.

### 5. Single-File Source-Code Launch
- Introduction of the ability to run a single-file Java source-code program directly without the need for compilation.
- This feature simplifies the development and execution of small Java programs and scripts.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Nest-Based Access Control
- Introduction of nest-based access control to support private access between members of nested classes.
- Nest-based access control simplifies the enforcement of access rules and improves security.

### 2. Dynamic Class-File Constants
- Introduction of dynamic class-file constants to support dynamic constants in the Java Virtual Machine.
- Dynamic class-file constants provide a more efficient way to represent constants in bytecode and improve performance.

### 3. TLS 1.3 Support
- Introduction of TLS 1.3 protocol support in the `javax.net.ssl` package.
- TLS 1.3 improves security, performance, and privacy compared to previous versions of the TLS protocol.

## Development Tools
- JDK 11 shipped with a comprehensive set of development tools, including `javac`, `java`, `jar`, and others.
- Tools facilitated compilation, execution, packaging, and debugging of Java programs.

## Community and Industry Impact
- JDK 11 represented a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java platform, introducing several features and enhancements aimed at improving developer productivity, security, and performance.
- HTTP Client, Flight Recorder, and Epsilon GC provided developers with new tools and capabilities for building modern Java applications.

## Conclusion
JDK 11 introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java platform, aimed at improving developer productivity, security, and performance. With the introduction of HTTP Client, Flight Recorder, and Epsilon GC, JDK 11 reinforced Java's position as a versatile and powerful programming language for building modern, scalable, and secure applications.
